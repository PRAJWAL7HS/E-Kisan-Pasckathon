# Introduction

The stats have proven that farming is the backbone of India's finance and the steps taken by government to help the farmers 
proves the same. So, as a part of the reponsible citizen's of India and upcoming engineers of the country, it is our duty to 
find every way posssible to help them in having a better lifestyle. This  was the motivation to start this project. 



# Problems Observed currently in farmers

1. Take time to gain Knowledge of Yojana's and various schemes and support released for them.

2. Use Experience to decide which crops should be grown. So, A person just starting up with farming will take time in making good decisions

3. Use Experience to decide the amount of water that should be put for best yield. So, A person just starting up with farming will take time in making good decisions.

4. Effective use of resources at their hand is not done

5. Lack of Affordable Equipments

6.Many More...

# How are we tackling some of these problem?

1. A One stop website for finding the ongoing schemes beneficial for farmers.

2. Using General trend of climate and other factors present in a particular area, using Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the yield of each Crop and displaying Top 5 Crops which can best grow in that area.

3. Water Required for each plant in the top 5 predicted crops.

4. Renting and hiring of Equipments from Farmers in nearby Area.

# Future Scope or Scalability Factor

1. Regional Language Support

2. Android Application Support

3. Chatbot Support for navigating through the website or other queries

4. Personalized Updates for every farmer by installing sensors in every land and observing the quality of the land and predicting plants using this data for more accurate suggestion.

5. Proving the facility to design personalized plan of getting out the maximum effective yield, if multiple land holdings and resources area are present.

6. Providing the facility to plan the effective use of the Yield to get the maximum outcome by taking requirement of every area into consideration.

7. Much More facilities can be added...

This proves the Scalability aspect of the Project.
